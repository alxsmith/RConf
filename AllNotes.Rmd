# New with shiny!

## Automated testing

  - `devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinytest")` To install the package from the github repo

  - `shinytest::recordTest()` To create a baseline

  - `shinytest::testApp()` To test the app after some package versions have been updated
  
  - `shinytest::snapshotupdate()` To update the snapshot taken during the recordTest
  

## Web Apps vs. Web APIs

  - Shiny does not work great for Web APIs
  
  - By using `session$api$data <- serveCSV(...)` with `/api/data`, you can access to data available through the API


# Whats new with the IDE?

# Shiny dashboards

## `shinydhasboards` package, more of this in the dashboards directory with live code examples

## `flexdashboard` package

  - `valueBox()` Function to create value boxes
  
  - `gauge()` Function to create gauges

## Dashboards + Shiny!

  - Can include shiny commands and functions, without having a ui - server logic
  
  - can generate the rmd with a uiOutput
  
  - `runtime: shiny_prerendered`
  
  
```{r, eval = F}

ui <- uiOutput("contents")

server <- 
  ...{
    output$contents <- renderUI({
      rmarkdown::render("source.Rmd")
    })
  }
  

```

# Websites with Rmd

  - `blogdown::new_site()` To install `Hugo`, and create a preview of a website
  
  - Embedded code, text output, graphics output supported, just like normal Rmd
  
  - The viewer listens to the document, no need to re-render the documents
  
  - Themes from Hugo can be used
  
  - `blogdown::new_post()` Creates the YAML metadata needed, and builds a new post under a new directory
  
  - From a normal Rmarkdown, one can use `output format: blogdown::html_page` to produce blogdowns

  - Rmarkdown calls Knitr, which translates everything into Markdown, and then calls pandoc, which translates everything into the desired output
