# Automated testing

  - `devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinytest")` To install the package from the github repo

  - `shinytest::recordTest()` To create a baseline

  - `shinytest::testApp()` To test the app after some package versions have been updated
  
  - `shinytest::snapshotupdate()` To update the snapshot taken during the recordTest
  

# Web Apps vs. Web APIs

  - Shiny does not work great for Web APIs
  
  - By using `session$api$data <- serveCSV(...)` with `/api/data`, you can access to data available through the API
